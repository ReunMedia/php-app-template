# Reun Media PHP app template

A starter template for PHP projects.

## Getting started

### Create project

This template is not published to Packagist, so use the command below to create
a new project.

```sh
composer create-project reun/php-app-template myapp --repository="{\"url\": \"https://github.com/ReunMedia/php-app-template\", \"type\": \"vcs\"}" --stability=dev --remove-vcs
```

### Install latest versions of dependencies

```sh
cd myapp
pnpm update
composer update
```

`update` is used instead of `install` to update lockfiles to latest versions of
dependencies.

Run `composer outdated -D` and `pnpm outdated` periodically to check for
outdated packages. If there are new major releases of packages out, feel free to
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/ReunMedia/php-app-template/pulls).

### Start development servers

```sh
pnpm dev
composer dev
```

You must run `pnpm dev` before `composer dev` if you want to use the dev server.
You can also run `pnpm build` instead of starting a dev server. See
[`reun/twig-utilities`
documentation](https://github.com/ReunMedia/twig-utilities/blob/master/docs/ViteAsset.md#vite-dev-server-detection)
for more info.

## Additional information

### `composer.json` package type

The default type for package in `composer.json` is `project`. Remove it or
change to `library` if creating a library.

### Application root in subdirectory and VS Code extensions

If you use a subdirectory for the application, you should add following
configuration to `.vscode/settings.json` to use PHPStan and PHP CS Fixer
extensions (replace `app` with the app root directory):

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "phpstan.rootDir": "app",
  "php-cs-fixer.config": "app/.php-cs-fixer.php"
}
```

## Additional setup tasks

- [ ] Change badges to point to your package in Packagist or remove them
- [ ] Add `LICENSE`
